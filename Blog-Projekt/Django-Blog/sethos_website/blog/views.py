        In every society, there are always individuals who feel they cannot coexist with society and thus seclude themselves from others. These are hikikomoris, also known as NEETs (Not in Employment, Education or Training), and whilst it's not that prevalent in my country, it is prevalent in Japan and perhaps even America, from the sites I have trudged through during my "hikikomori life" of 6 months when I was transitioning between my old degree to my current degree. I was technically still attending university, but I would definitely consider myself as one during that time. And those 6 months was a mixed bag of emotions. Hikikomori life is not always what an individual chooses. Sometimes they feel afraid to step outside their boundaries, even though they attempt to try to rid themselves of the hikikomori life. This is prevalent in our main character Tatsuhiro Satou, a 22 year old college dropout, turned hikikomori for 4 years. From the anime, we observe the daily struggles of Satou, and how he attempts to becomes less of a hikikomori, and how he uses a conspiracy theory of an organisation, the N.H.K to vent his frustrations of becoming a hikikomori. Then comes in a mysterious high-school girl, Misaki Nakahara, who promises to change Sato's life for good. The anime reflects on what pushes some to the hikikomori life - like the leering eyes on the train if you buy an anime figure, which gives us a perspective on why some "prefer" the hikikomori life as they want to avoid getting looked down upon.The progression of Satou's attempts to become more open to society and escape his hikikomori life is a really powerful image. From barely being able to get out of his room to being comfortable to talk to others, the anime just allows us to experience so many types of emotions - cringe, sadness, hopelessness, happiness, and so on, and that's all the feelings that comes with the struggles of life, or in this case, the struggles of changing one self, the struggles of stepping out of their comfort zones. For me, the anime really made me reflect about those 6 months last year, where I was drifting away in a soulless body, and some of the scenes in the anime made me tear up. Looking at the main characters, Satou is not really your typical definition of a hikikomori, in terms of attitude. All he really needed was guidance and a little push, which we see from Misaki, and all the other characters in his life. The anime also focused on the idea that everyone deals with their struggles in life differently, and so they should, and this is prevalent in all our characters, whether or not they are hikikomori, otaku, working, etc. Each character was flawed and no one was perfect, but that's what made this anime so realistic. This was prevalent between the two main characters - Misaki and Sato, who keeps the truth away from each other and also themselves.The theme of suicide was an aspect of the anime I really found relatable. During the suicide party episode, we just see a bunch of depressed individuals who want to end their lives, because of stupid reasons (ironically none of them were hikikomori other than Sato). And Sato was just the one who went with the flow, and eventually became the one who had the strongest intention to commit suicide. It really shows how flawed humans are, and how we look to end our sufferings quickly, and those scenes really made me tear up, since I had some serious suicidal thoughts during those 6 months of hikikomori life and also the earlier months of my university life. For me, the last episode made a lasting impact on me because of Misaki. From the outside, we see a charming woman who had the best of intentions to help others, but as we progress through the anime, and Sato becomes more capable to rid himself of the hikikomori life, we see despair in Misaki, and how she has "lost her purpose in life". The two of them alone fighting and comforting one another was hard to watch, yet heartwarming, because that is what life is all about. When bad comes, we should look to comfort one another.In conclusion, NHK ni Youkoso was an extremely enjoyable anime that highlights the prevalence of hikikomoris, and how many are "pushed" to this lifestyle because of the lack of support and comfort. The anime delves on the struggles of life in general, the darker sides of life - the concept of suicide, our purpose in life and how we all deal with struggles of life differently. But that's just from my experiences and how I perceived this anime, and it's bound to be different to how another views this anime, especially the emotions that this anime evokes. The anime ending was a heart-warming nevertheless, but the manga, novel and anime all had different stories and takes on the story. And that's a good thing, everyone has different viewpoints and experiences of the struggles of life - being a hikikomori is one of them.

        Would you like to just play video games all day and are you really good at it? Nobody can compete with you? The world offers no challenges for you? Then how about a world where all problems are decided with games? Admittedly, it sounds unrealistic, but it is precisely this childish concept that No Game No Life wants to  take on. You can find out here whether that works out well or whether a few of the girls' clothes just fly  . Content "No Game No Life" The siblings  Sora and Shiro are  NEETs or so-called shut-ins. Essentially people who don't leave the house, or worse, their room, unless absolutely necessary. They use their everyday life to play video games from morning to night. They are famous on the internet under the alias Blank . One day she receives an e-mail from an unknown sender who challenges her to a game of chess. After winning the game, a text appears on your screen "How do you like your world?" Suddenly, they are drawn into another world where all conflicts are decided by games and a stake from both sides. There are 10 rules set by the god Tetowere created and which affect the games. In this world, the gamer duo tries to unite the 16 races, challenge Teto again and become gods of the new world. Will they make it? Figure it out! © KSM Anime Picture and sound What makes "No Game No Life" special in my eyes are the colors. You rarely see black, hard outlines, but rather thin, colorful edges and lights. Equally impressive are the environments of the individual races. Whether it's the stone city of humans, the forest of elves, or the Asian territories of the Eastern Federation. They are all drawn in great detail and appear imaginative and playful. The only drawback is the fan service of the series: As is usually the case with women, there are only two types of bust sizes, either double Z or none. Furthermore, they are very popular to put on display. However, if you can handle it or even look forward to it, you will get your money's worth here. The soundtrack offers a variety of songs that contribute to the respective situations: quiet strumming along with the everyday, exciting sounds for groundbreaking moments, playful melodies for imaginative races or songs that get your blood pumping at the beginning of the game. Shinji Hosoe proves how impressive that can be. I would particularly like to recommend the song “ All of you is all of me” to you. It's just fun to listen to "No Game No Life"  . The German synchronization is bombastic good. The voice actors really do their best to bring the characters to life and present them in a comedic way. A thousand thumbs up for the great work! © KSM Anime Trivia Thiago Furukawa Lucas , also known as the author under the pseudonym Yuu Kamiya , wrote " No Game No Life" as a light novel. Light novels are novels with a lighter content that have manga-style illustrations here and there for the characters or certain situations in the story. Since the success of the light novels and anime, Yuu Kamiya has been helping out with the manga adaptation of the original. As an animation studio, MADHOUSE Inc. has always created anime projects that are unusual or different. Therefore, animes such as B. "One-Punch Man", "Death Parade" or "BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad" emerged from her house. With us, KSM secured the rights to the anime and launched a beautiful complete box on May 17th, 2018. I can only recommend this, because in addition to the usual trailers, picture gallery and openings/endings, there are also two extras that surprised me positively. First, we have the OVAs, which are short stories alongside the main events of the anime . And although they don't offer much new, they convince with the usual humor of the series. On the other hand there are the episodes with audio commentaries of the characters. That is nothing new? Read more carefully: Characters. That's right, it's not the producers or the voice actors who comment on the scenes, but the sometimes idiotic characters, who brought me to tears here and there. I can recommend these extras to everyone!   © KSM Anime Conclusion No Game No Life is an OP protagonist comedy through and through. Despite the large amount of fan service, which is also well integrated into jokes, the world and the characters surprise with their naivety and finesse at the same time. Sounds funny, but that's how it is. While there isn't a highly branching or intriguing story, that's also what makes this anime so great. If you need something light for one or two nice evenings to end the day and something for the eyes and ears, this anime is in good hands. A clear recommendation from me!

The average viewer will be utterly and completely stumped after the first half-hour.""",
        "content": """
        Anime's most rebellious show about being a teenager is no longer a teen. April marks 20 years since the first broadcast of FLCL (short for "Fooly Cooly," a term which itself doesn't really mean anything), a raucous and anarchic six-episode series that rewrote the animation rulebook with its whirlpool of contemporary pop culture, sucking in and breaking apart everything in its orbit like the "manly aestheticism" of John Woo, the bullet time of The Matrix, and even the cut-out cartoon style of South Park. It proved a lasting influence as a noted inspiration on other cultural behemoths, like Avatar: The Last Airbender and its sequel show The Legend of Korra. (Director Giancarlo Volpe said the crew was "ordered to watch every single episode.") FLCL stands out even two decades later through its hyperactive, innuendo-laden, and borderline nonsensical storytelling presented through often abstract visuals. (Watch it on Hulu!) There were so many references that the team localizing the anime to English often struggled with the script, citing the weird and niche in-jokes that would be easily lost in translation. Director Kazuya Tsurumaki, a longtime animator at studio Gainax and protégé to Neon Genesis Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno, ambitiously set out to break the established rules of anime through its eclectic visuals, anti-narrative approach, and unusual soundtrack, trading in classical motifs for thrashing guitars and heavy percussion from the contemporary Japanese rock band The Pillows. Gainax Created alongside writer Yōji Enokido (also a veteran of Evangelion, as well as Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena), the series found a cult audience abroad through airing on Adult Swim in 2003, which grew with repeat syndication in the channel's Toonami block in 2013 and again in 2018. Following that last broadcast, the show made a surprising return in June 2018 with a second season and third season, titled FLCL: Progressive and Alternative, respectively, though expanding on the material and its sci-fi mythology had diminishing returns. At first, the basic premise of the original series sounds simple enough: Naota Nandaba is an ordinary sixth grader living in Mabase, a city where "nothing amazing happens." After his brother Tasuku leaves town to play baseball in America, Naota looks after all that Tasuku left behind, from his top bunk bed to his ex-girlfriend Mamimi Samejima, who clings to Naota in Tasuku's absence. The mundanity of Naota's small-town life is shaken up by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, a red-haired psychopath riding a yellow Vespa and wielding a bass guitar like a battle axe. Their first encounter leaves Naota with a strange, giant horn on his head, from which a large robot (named Canti) springs forth. Things only get stranger from there. Driven by an experimental and surrealist style, FLCL resists the tropes of coming-of-age stories, defying narrative logic and instead relying on impulse. Similarly, the animation itself played fast and loose with any kind of rules. The characters and the world around them are equally flexible and fluid, as FLCL takes any shape that it pleases at any one moment: buildings bounce and rebound as people have fights within them, split screens actively intrude on the real world as characters are squished against them.  The characters themselves question what the hell is going on -- in one of its earliest major digressions where the show suddenly turns into an animated manga, Naota's father questions what the term FLCL even means ("How should I know?" Naota responds). Every episode is intentionally bewildering in a manner that reflects Naota's chaotic emotional state and the shock of entering adolescence. The very act of growing up in FLCL seems ridiculous within itself, considering that most of the show's lecherous adults are less competent and even more immature than the kids. Tsurumaki and Enokido recognize and embrace that, choosing to mock almost every familiar coming-of-age trope as the kids are left to figure out their confusion on their own terms. As with every other concept chewed up and spit back out by FLCL, it twists a well-trodden trope into something absurd, such as its constant engagement with body horror, a tried-and-true metaphor for the pains of growing up represented by some kind of grotesque metamorphosis. Look no further than the giant robot that bursts from the horn (said to be "brought on by impure thoughts") on Naota's forehead. As a whole the show is rather pointedly obsessed with the flesh, whether through its ridiculous body horror or at characters being ogled, and the primary focus of both of these impulses is Haruko, a Looney Tunes-esque character in how she smashes everything around her, the fourth wall included. Naota craves and detests Haruko's attention, his view of her often characterized by predatory behavior. Fully aware of these mechanics (even poking fun at the idea that she's a figment of Naota's imagination), Haruko uses this to toy with him, like a cat with a mouse. But despite Naota's wariness of her, she represents something outside of his boring home life. Gainax Like the show itself, Haruko brings unpredictability into his life, as every episode brings some new scenario that almost defies analysis: You could watch each episode multiple times and still be left in the cold as to what it "means" or what, on a story level, the hell is actually happening. Haruko's meddling makes the show increasingly frantic, as innocuous baseball matches turn into a setup for the apocalypse, high school stage productions turn into battle grounds for giant bug robots, or characters simply get blown away by machine guns to walk away just fine. What's real and what's metaphor eventually stops mattering, all that's left is to go by how it makes you feel (usually, confused).    During the final episode of FLCL, Naota snaps at his family in another long meta-joke that "it doesn't matter what FLCL is," and that much is true. Like the teens at its center, it's defiant of authority, so often rejecting genre convention that trying to categorize it is a waste of time. It's not strictly action, not strictly comedy, not really a mecha anime or any one thing -- even to call it surrealist feels like too restrictive a term. At its very core it represents the necessary rebellion of adolescence, the beginning of a path towards independence.

        Hideaki Anno's anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the greatest animated works of all time. It also has one of the most bizarre and baffling endings of all time. While the allure of the show comes from images of giant robots fighting monsters, it is more than just spectacle, and its ending makes sure the audience knows that. Anno wants to create something deeper than just mindless violence. Instead, he creates complex lore for the series that reduces humanity to nothing but ants and displays the inevitability of death at the hands of a higher power. He deals with themes of religion, isolation, and what it means to be a human. In short, the series is absolutely soul-crushing. 5.7KDuchess of Sussex feels heartbroken over the death of her friend Oli JusteNeon Genesis Evangelion has served as the inspiration for future anime series, such as the Gundam series and Gurren Lagan. But there is more to Neon Genesis Evangelion than the original show. It has spawned a franchise of films that retell the series and, importantly, rewrite the ending.For the purposes of this piece, I’ll be focusing on the original ending of the 1995 series. It is considered the most perplexing and was completely unexpected, as the last two episodes become obscure examinations of the human mind rather than the expected epic battle for humanity. However, it feels almost appropriate in the show’s trajectory and slow transition into psychoanalysis. The series begins in Toyko-3 after a cataclysmic event called Second Impact. Two million people were killed, polar ice caps melted, and scientists confirmed the existence of both Adam and Lilith, the two original angels created by a progenitor race. Adam and Lilith are seeds of life, extraterrestrial beings responsible for angels and humans, respectively.First Impact occurred billions of years ago when Lilith crashed to Earth. Adam was already here, poised to create the race of angels. It is disastrous for two seeds of life to be on the same planet, so only one can prevail. Both beings were equipped with an extraterrestrial weapon called the spear of Longinus, and Adam’s spear activated and essentially sedated him. This left Lilith to populate Earth and bring about humans, or Lillin as they are sometimes called. Now, after an apocalyptic event, humanity is facing another doom: monsters called Angels, which are the children of Adam. These angels are not the winged humans often depicted in religious works; instead, Neon Genesis Evangelion‘s angels are monstrous forms whose goal is to reclaim Earth and destroy humanity.To fight these powerful beings, the mysterious organization NERV creates giant mechs, or robots, called Evas that can only be piloted by teenagers. Shinji Ikari is one of the select few who can meld his nervous system with his Eva Unit-01. Using this bond between child and machine, Shinji and the other pilots are able to commandeer the Evas and throw themselves in battle with extraterrestrial forces.Yet as these teenagers believe their sacrifices are helping save humanity, they are in fact being manipulated by NERV and Seele (the German word for soul), another secret government organization. The leaders of Seele use children to bring about Third Impact and human instrumentality.Human instrumentality is a crucial concept to understanding Neon Genesis Evangelion and its ending. Seele wishes to bring about this event as the next step in human evolution, which involves forcing all human souls to come together and create one amorphous being. Here, humans can fill the holes in each other’s hearts and minds, which is a seeming cure for loneliness and insecurity. In this form, humans can become closer to God. While there is no obvious marker of the beginning of human instrumentality, it can be argued that it begins at the end of Episode 24, with Episodes 25 and 26 illustrating Shinji’s own assimilation in the amalgamation of humanity and subsequent rejection of the process. Episode 24 culminates in the murder of the seventeenth and final angel, Kaworu Nagisa, at the hands of Shinji. Dwarfed in the hand of Shinji’s Eva, Kowuro asks for death as a final act of freedom, declaring that he no longer wishes to destroy humanity; he instead wants it to survive.While the destruction of the final angel would seem to be what saves humanity, it instead kickstarts the doom planned by Seele. It is not explicitly shown how or why, but with the strange events of the following episode, it can be deduced that the human instrumentality project has begun.The death of Kaworu is dramatic, epic in size, and feels as if everyone is teetering on the precipice of disaster. But Anno subverts these expectations with the final two episodes, which are sparsely animated and rather subdued, fueled only by dialogue.Both episodes completely change in tone and aesthetics as no mechs are shown and there is no dramatic reveal about what human instrumentality looks like. Instead, Anno chooses a much more introspective look at the apocalypse and what goes through someone’s mind as they dissolve into one massive form. In Episode 25, Shinji is shown sitting in a dark room with his head in his hands. Here he contemplates who he is and how truly lonely he feels. Around him, characters question him about life, as well as try to parse their own experiences and traumas.These intermingled moments of realization illustrate how everyone is slowly coming together, melding hearts and minds. They all finally know each other, their deepest fears, their worst memories, and their strongest anxieties. In coming together, they will somehow fill the holes in each other’s hearts. Everything is laid bare as they are slowly becoming one. Then comes Episode 26, where human instrumentality is almost complete and Shinji is still trying to understand his purpose outside of being an Eva pilot. He contemplates his place in the world, and despite his ennui, he ultimately realizes he wants to remain his own person. He refuses to be assimilated into a formless being and instead grasps onto his humanity. Shinji has discovered his worth. With his rejection of instrumentality comes perhaps the most baffling moment of the series: his friends and family stand around him, clapping, and saying, “Congratulations.” While anticlimactic, it illustrates that this series is not about fighting monsters, but about reconciling what it means to exist. Life comes with pain, loneliness, and sadness, but it is better than feeling nothing at all. Shinji is being congratulated for recognizing his own emotions and seeing them as what makes him, him. This ending understandably angered fans. Anno’s original ending shifts from spectacle to psychoanalysis. Gainax, the studio that created Neon Genesis Evangelion, is known for its financial struggles, so a lack of resources was partially blamed for the strange and incomplete series finale. All the money had been spent in the rising action, with nothing left for the climax. But it wasn’t just financial struggles that plagued the production. Anno had no idea how he wanted to end the series. Neon Genesis Evangelion was born from Anno’s four-year depression, so he grappled with how to encapsulate not only the end of the world but a seeming “end” to mental illness. He struggled with this ending and wound up rewriting it several times in films such as The End of Evangelion, which explicitly shows what happens during instrumentality, and Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, which further explains Seele’s plan. But, as there is no end to mental illness, for Anno, there is no true ending for Neon Genesis Evangelion. The original ending of the show illustrates that despite the suffering of existence, it is better than feeling nothing at all. There is no true cure for loneliness or self-hatred, or any of the negative emotions that come with being human.Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show ultimately about acknowledging depression and loneliness and realizing that even the smallest life has a purpose. No higher power or secret organization can truly control a person’s fate; it is crucial that people instead hold on to their own experiences to remain aware of who they are.
